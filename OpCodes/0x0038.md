## Description

Sets the lower-word of `CliEventModeLocal` to a masked value.

`CliEventModeLocal` is used to tell the client how the event should alter the client state. This includes things like:

  * Hiding the local player entity to allow the game to control the camera.
  * Hiding the various UI elements during an event. (Compass, target window, party window, etc.)
  * Moving the camera separate from the local player entity.
  * Altering how movement works (probably to allow for certain camera adjustments/movements.)
  * etc.

For example, `Ailevia` in Southern San d'Oria has an event that will take control of the camera and point it left/right explaining the area. \
This sets this flag to `0x2003` when this happens.

## Source Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0038(xievent_t *this)
{
    const auto val = FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 1);

    *(uint16_t*)&PTR_CliEventModeLocal = HIBYTE(val) | 0x20;

    this->ExecPointer += 3;
}
```
