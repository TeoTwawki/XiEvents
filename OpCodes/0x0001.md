# OpCode: 0x0001

| Information               | Notes |
|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `01 ?? ??` |
| **OpCode Size**           | `3`   |
| **Sets `RetFlag`?**       | `No`  |
| **Sets `ExecPointer`?**   | `Yes` |

## Description

Directly sets the `ExecPointer` position. 

This does not make use of the jump stack and is not intended to be returned from without directly setting the position again. _(This works similar to a `goto` statement in most programming languages.)_

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0001(xievent_t* this)
{
    this->ExecPointer = FUNC_XiEvent_eventgetcode(this, 1);
}
```
