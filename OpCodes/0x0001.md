# OpCode: 0x0001

| Information               | Notes |
|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `01 ?? ??` |
| **OpCode Size**           | `3`   |
| **Sets `RetFlag`?**       | `Yes` |
| **Sets `ExecPointer`?**   | `Yes` |

## Description

Sets the current `ExecPointer` by force. This does not make use of the jump stack and is not intended to have any means of being returned from. This is intended to directly force a jump. (Works the same way as `goto` in other programming languages.)

The jump offset is read via `XiEvent::eventgetcode`.

## Source Code

```cpp
int __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0001(xievent_t *this)
{
    const auto offset = FUNC_XiEvent_eventgetcode(this, 1);
    this->ExecPointer = offset;

    return offset;
}
```
