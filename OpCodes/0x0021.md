## Description

Sets the `EventExecEnd` flag value to `1`.

`EventExecEnd` is a flag that is checked when `XiEvent::EventIdle` is called before the `XiEvent::ExecProg` loop beings. If true, then the loop will not start for the current tick.

`PTR_UnknownFlag` is currently unknown for its entire purpose. However, it is used to tell the client to cleanup the previous event state in some ways. This flag has 3 values (0, 1, 2) which is stepped through as the client is cleaning up from an ended event. This is used while looping the full entity map looking for valid entities who have a current `EventPointer` value and proper render flags for an event or event related task. (Talking, movement, etc.) This value is used to reset the entities event information back to defaults.

_This flag is used in a pretty long function, but for now it's not too important to dig into more._

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0021(xievent_t *this)
{
    PTR_EventExecEnd = 1;

    if (!PTR_UnknownFlag)
        PTR_UnknownFlag = 1;

    this->RetFlag = 1;
}
```
