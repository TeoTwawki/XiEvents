|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `12 ?? ??` |
| **OpCode Size**           | `3`   |

## Description

Generates a random number via `rand()` and stores it.

_This makes use of the `XiEvent::setworkofs` function, thus the value that is used and the location it is written to is dependent on the values passed in the opcode._

## Source Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0012(xievent_t *this)
{
    FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 1, rand());

    this->ExecPointer += 3;
}
```
