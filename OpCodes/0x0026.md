| Information               | Notes |
|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `26`  |
| **OpCode Size**           | `1`   |
| **Sets `RetFlag`?**       | `Yes` |
| **Sets `ExecPointer`?**   | `No`  |

## Description

Yields the event VM.

_**Note:** This opcode may be deprecated. Since it only ever sets the `RetFlag` the opcode will never advance further leaving it in an endless self-handled cycle each time the VM is ticked._

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0026(xievent_t *this)
{
    this->RetFlag = 1;
}
```
