## Description

Sets an unknown flag value.

_Appears to be related to playing sound effects, and removing a limit on how many can play at once? Default appears to be 12 in the client internally, then this allows that to be uncapped to 20._

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x00D9(xievent_t* this)
{
    PTR_UnknownFlag = this->EventData[this->ExecPointer + 1] == 0;

    this->ExecPointer += 2;
}
```
