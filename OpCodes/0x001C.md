# OpCode: 0x001C

| Information               | Notes |
|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `1C ?? ??`  |
| **OpCode Size**           | `3`   |
| **Sets `RetFlag`?**       | `Yes` |
| **Sets `ExecPointer`?**   | `Yes` |

## Description

Sets, or updates (decreases), the current `ReqStack[RunPos].WaitTime` value.

This opcode works similar to a coroutine being yielded. 

When first called, this opcode will check if the `ReqStack[RunPos].WaitTime` is < 0.0. If true, then the `WaitTime` will be set from the value read from the opcode. 

Next, the handler will begin ticking the `WaitTime` down every time the handler is called again. Each time the handler is called, `RetFlag` is set to 1, breaking the `XiEvent::ExecProg` loop every tick. The opcode does not advance the `ExecPointer` forward until the `WaitTime` reaches < 0.0 again.

## Source Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x001C(xievent_t *this)
{
    if (this->ReqStack[this->RunPos].WaitTime < 0.0)
        this->ReqStack[this->RunPos].WaitTime = FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 1);

    this->ReqStack[this->RunPos].WaitTime -= FUNC_GetFrameDelay();
    this->RetFlag = 1;

    if (this->ReqStack[this->RunPos].WaitTime < 0.0)
        this->ExecPointer += 3;
}
```
