## Description

Opens the map window with the given properties. This handler is used mainly when an NPC opens your map but it is not with the sub-menus visible. Mainly to show an overview of the map with no extra bloat on screen or markings on the map.

For example, `Luthiaque` in `Southern San d'Oria` will open the full map of Sandy showing how the various areas connect to each other.

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x008D(xievent_t* this)
{
    const auto val1 = FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 1);
    const auto val2 = FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 3);
    FUNC_OpenMap2(1, val1, val2, 0, 0);

    this->ExecPointer += 5;
}
```
