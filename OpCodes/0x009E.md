## Description

Sets the `PTR_RectEventSendFlag` value.

This flag is used when loading areas in a zone while the event is happening. This tells the client how the areas should be loaded, such as if it's simply a visual look of the area, or if the player is being moved to that location. This flag tells the client if it should send region updates (packet `0x00F2`) or not based on if the event is moving the player.

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x009E(xievent_t* this)
{
    PTR_RectEventSendFlag = this->EventData[this->ExecPointer + 1] == 0;
    this->ExecPointer += 2;
}
```
