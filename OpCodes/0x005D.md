## Description

Sets, or eases, the current playing music to a new volume.

`FUNC_YmMusicServer_Volume` - Sets the current playing music volume. Takes two parameters, the first being the desired volume level to [eventually] set, the second is the amount of time to ease into the desired volume. 0 would immediately set the volume.

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x005D(xievent_t *this)
{
    FUNC_YmMusicServer_Volume(FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 1), FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 3));
    this->ExecPointer += 5;
}
```
