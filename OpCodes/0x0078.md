| **OpCode**                | `78`  |
| **OpCode Size**           | `1`   |

## Description

Enables the game timer and resets the zone weather.

`PTR_UnknownFlag` is set to 1 by opcode `0x00A9`, which appears to be a flag to tell some of the time calculation functions that they are being overridden.

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0078(xievent_t* this)
{
    if (PTR_EnvironmentFlag)
    {
        FUNC_XiDateTime_EnableGameTimer();
        
        PTR_UnknownFlag = 0;
    }

    FUNC_ResetWeatherNow();

    this->ExecPointer++;
}
```
